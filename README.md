# Netflix-clone

A Netflix clone I created for the sake of practicing `React` and authentification using `Firebase`. It features design patterns recommended by the documentation. Some of the tools used include:

- Hooks (and custom hooks)
- React Router dom
- Responsive web design
- Firebase 

It is a work in progress, and my first real project with React. Any tips on how to better write the code, manage the folder structure, etc would be really appreciated.
